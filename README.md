2. Clone the project from this Github repository. [project] (https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)
3. Open Git Bash and type in *cd /vagrant/tournament*. Then type in "vagrant up".
4. After the VM has loaded. Type in vagrant ssh. After you see a $ prompt, type in "cd /" then "ls".
5. You will see a directory called vagrant. Type in "cd /vagrant/tournament". Type in "ls".
6. You will see three existing versions of tournament.py, tournament.sql, and tournament_test.py
7. Copy and paste the tournament.py, and tournament.sq found in the NewMay2015 repository into the user/fullstack/vagrant/tournament folder on your pc.
8. Now in the Git Bash command shell, type in psql.
